## Project Description
  
  This project for CS410 Rust will be a text based game. The main purpose of this game is for me, the developer,  
  to become more familiar with the Rust Programming Language. The story of the game is based off the many little  
  stories I tell my daughter when I walk her to school. The main character in the story is a seven year old girl.  
  Like every other school day she wakes up to go to school but, this day will be a little different.  
  When starting up the game the player will be presented with a menu of options to perform and a  
  description of their surroundings. The player will then try to go to school.
