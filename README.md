## Project Description
  
  This project for CS410 Rust will be a text based game. The main purpose of this game is for me, the developer,  
  to become more familiar with the Rust Programming Language. The story of the game is based off the many little  
  stories I tell my daughter when I walk her to school. The main character in the story is a seven year old girl.  
  Like every other school day she wakes up to go to school but, this day will be a little different.  
  When starting up the game the player will be presented with a menu of options to perform and a  
  description of their surroundings. The player will then try to go to school.

  The player of the game will travle through Rooms. While moving between rooms the player will be able to interact
  with items, enemies, and exits. Sometimes the player will pick up items to attack enemies. Other times the player
  will attack enemies or get stuck in a dead end.

#### Referenced

  for this project I heavily referenced Jude Southworth's github  
  @ https://github.com/JellyWX/adventure-rs/blob/85903392d74b58889ede2a84b6dc5308f02594d6/src/main.rs  
  I also referenced a code review thread on their project   
  @ https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/205066/beginner-rust-text-adventure 

  I referenced their github and the forum codereview to view how they organized their objects and code. When
  I initially played their text-based game their game only hade 2 or 3 rooms and no enemies.
